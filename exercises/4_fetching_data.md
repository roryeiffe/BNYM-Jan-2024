# Angular Exercise 4: Fetching Data from an API

## Description

Use Angular services to fetch data from a public API and display it in your application.

## Approach

1. Create a new Angular service for API communication.
2. Use `HttpClient` to fetch data from a public API.
3. Display the fetched data in an Angular component.
4. Style the component using CSS.
5. Write tests for the service to ensure proper handling of API responses and errors.

## Hints

- Explore Angular's `HttpClientModule` for API requests.
- Handle API responses and errors gracefully in your service.
- Use mock data to test the service independently of the API.

## Deliverables

- An Angular component that successfully displays data fetched from a public API.
