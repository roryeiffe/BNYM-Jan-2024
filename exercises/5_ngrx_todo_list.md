# Angular Exercise 5: Introduction to NgRx in Todo List

## Description

Refactor the Todo List application to incorporate NgRx for state management.

## Approach

1. Integrate NgRx into the existing Todo List application.
2. Define actions and reducers for adding, displaying, and deleting tasks.
3. Use NgRx Store to manage the application's state.
4. Refactor the component to use NgRx Store instead of local state.
5. Write tests to ensure NgRx integration works correctly.

## Hints

- Familiarize yourself with NgRx concepts like actions, reducers, and selectors.
- Ensure that the state changes are correctly reflected in the UI.
- Test the state management thoroughly, including edge cases.

## Deliverables

- A refactored `TodoList` application using NgRx for state management.
