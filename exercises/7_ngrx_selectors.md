# Angular Exercise 8: NgRx Selectors and Store Design

## Description

Expand the user profile editor to include more complex user information, utilizing NgRx selectors to manage and access different parts of the state.

## Approach

1. Enhance the user profile structure with more detailed information.
2. Use NgRx selectors to access and manipulate specific parts of the state.
3. Implement a more complex store design to handle the expanded user profile.
4. Update the `UserProfileEditor` component to interact with the new store structure.
5. Write tests for selectors and store structure.

## Hints

- Deep dive into NgRx store and understand how selectors work.
- Create a robust and scalable store design.
- Test selectors for correctness and performance.

## Deliverables

- A sophisticated `UserProfileEditor` with an advanced NgRx store implementation.
