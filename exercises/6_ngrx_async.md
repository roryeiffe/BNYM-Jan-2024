# Angular Exercise 6: NgRx Effects for Asynchronous Operations

## Description

Enhance the blog application by fetching posts using NgRx effects to handle asynchronous operations.

## Approach

1. Implement NgRx effects to fetch posts from an API.
2. Integrate the effects with the existing blog application.
3. Handle the asynchronous flow and update the application state accordingly.
4. Refactor the components to use the updated state.
5. Write tests for the effects to ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations.

## Hints

- Explore how NgRx effects manage side effects and asynchronous calls.
- Use `Actions` and `Effects` modules from NgRx.
- Test the effects by mocking API responses and observing state changes.

## Deliverables

- Enhanced blog application with posts fetched using NgRx effects.
